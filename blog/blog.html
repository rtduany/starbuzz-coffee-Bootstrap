					  <h3>Starbuzz meets social media</h3>
					  <h5>3/12/2012 by Starbuzz CEO</h5>
					  <p>Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. In fact, we're going further than any of our competitors
						  and we're very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that links your coffee drinking directly to your 
						  social network. Forget "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and with this new product every sip of smooth, 
						  aromatic, hot Starbuzz blend is going to to be shared with your social network.</p>
					  <p>Sound like science fiction? It's not; I'm already testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this, 
						  which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social networks. We've made a huge investment to make this 
						  happen and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few 
						  more things the tech folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy).</p>
					  <p>So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about 
						  this new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.</p>
					  <h3>Starbuzz uses computer science</h3>
					  <h5>3/10/2012 by Starbuzz CEO</h5>
					  <p>Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee house is? The lines alway move fast, and despite the 
						  astronomical number of different drinks any customer can order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the 
						  way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it?</p>
					  <p>To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and greatest in computer science. In fact, we train our staff to 
						  be one big distributed computer. The cashiers create the orders for the distributed computer, complete with your 
						  name and the drinks special instructions. Then our specialized drink makers grab the next cup and go about working 
						  on your order until it's finished.</p>
					  <p>With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation any time we want. All we need to do is add more 
						  cashiers and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support staff you never see) as the customer flow 
						  grows.</p>
					  <h3>Most unique patron of the month</h3>
					  <h5>2/18/2012 by Starbuzz CEO</h5>
					  <p>Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order is a 
						  "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte, with the splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we 
						  have unique customers or what?</p>
